# PlantLightSystem-ArduinoLibrary (WIP)
This Library has status WIP (Work In Progress).

This part is an Arduino Library, which delivers core operability of Rack Node in PLS (Plant Light System) project.
## Description
Collectors of tropical plants may encounter a problem with the lack of light due to seasonal variations or the absence of properly sunlit areas that would guarantee the plants' optimal growth. That is why many of them rely on lamp systems (often homemade) to supplement or even completely replace natural sunlight. Unfortunately, such lamps need to be manually turned on (or used with a timer), require additional accessories for measuring environmental parameters (such as a hygrometer, thermometer), and often do not have an aesthetically pleasing appearance.

This project aims to create a fully automated lighting system for indoor plants that can be constructed by individuals. The system will collect analytical data from various sensors, and you will be able to control the lamp using an external application.

Project consists on three parts:

1. [Central Node] TBD
2. [Rack Node] TBD
3. [Application] TBD
